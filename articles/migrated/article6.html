    <p>
        14th district California Congressional candidate Cristiña Osmena has conflicted feelings on immigration in the United States. She believes in stricter immigration policies and wants stronger borders; however, she herself is an immigrant.
    </p>
    <p>
        “My father was put in prison,” Ms.Osmeña said. “My mother, brother and I fled the Philippines from a dictatorship.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Osmeña came to the United States at the age of 6 fleeing a dictatorship and said it was a “culture shock” and she had a “hard time adjusting to a new environment.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Osmeña visited Summit Shasta High School on August 23 for a mock press conference with the students of Summit News. She pushed for stronger immigration and border laws and believes that if immigrants come to the United States they should come legally,
        no matter the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to <a href="http://www.apa.org/topics/immigration/undocumented-video.aspx">www.apa.org</a> there are 1 million undocumented children in the United States. Ms.Osmeña believes that the United States needs stronger borders; however, she
        herself is an immigrant and understands the difficulties an immigrant children face.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Osmeña argued that her background is one of the many reasons as to why she would make a good candidate for the diverse 14th district of California. Ms. Osmeña said, “It's time for a immigrant to have a chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Osmeña states that she wants legal immigrants and for the country to grow. She believes that because of her diversity she would be a good congressional candidate. However, she continues to push for stronger borders and stricter immigration which would
        make immigrating to the United States much harder.
