        Jackie Speier, who is the incumbent for the 14th district of California, has a new challenger running for representative, Cristina Osmena. 
        Jackie as of now, <a href="https://speier.house.gov/">focuses on Women's rights, privacy, consumer safety, advocate for immigration, and affordable health care</a>. 
        Jackie has been in office for ten years now and has caught the attention of many for what she works and fights for as a representative.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Speier’s 10 years of office, she addressed these problems and made sure she made an impact towards them such as making speeches and creating bills to address these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Speier was born here in San Francisco California and did come from a line of immigration as her father was an immigrant from Germany. 
        But on the other hand, her mother was born in Fresno, California.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Ms. Speier’s 10 years in office, she has been featured in many interviews and articles detailing what she believes in. For example, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/ryan-painter/b-c-needs-to-support-workers-mental-health-and-mandate-paid-sick-leave_a_23219883/">this September 2017 Huffington Post column</a> cites Ms. Speier as saying, “We need affordable childcare and paid sick leave so workers don’t have to choose between their health and their livelihood.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Speier stated, “We need affordable childcare and paid sick leave so workers don't have to choose between their health and their livelihood.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ms. Speier also wrote <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-jackie-speier/unequal-pay-day_b_1430766.html">a personal column</a> for the Huffington Post describing the impact of wage gap between men and women. She wrote, “Since President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, the gap between men and women’s earnings has narrowed by less than a half-cent per year. At this rate, American women will have to wait until 2062 to bring home the same salary as their male counterparts.”
