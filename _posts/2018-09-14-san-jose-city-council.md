Many of the politicians in San Jose have made a difference for everyone in the past and are still making differences as we speak. These people have been through the hard process of campaigning, and many of them have needed to get closer to the voters and make themselves seem as if they were average people, trying to make a difference. To do this, many of them share their own personal life stories as to how they have come to be here, and many of them also talk about their past careers and qualifications. This article will shed light and touch on how some of these city politicians have gotten to where they are now, what their beliefs are, and how they aim to influence society some of their goals and accomplishments for society.

### San Jose City Council: District 1

San Jose City Council member from District 1, Charles Jones, also known as “Chappie,” was elected for office in November 2014 with 60 percent of the vote. He spent his early years in the city of Sacramento, and, in 1990, moved with his family to San Jose. He was raised by his parents with the ideals that he should participate in helping out his city and community as much as he can. To this day, he still holds those values as he helps the people of his district in various ways to meet the needs of the community.

Mr. Jones, whose term in office expires at the end of this year, went on to win re-election earlier this year in June. In 2014, the race for his current term, Mr. Jones ran against six others in the primary elections, and, this year, he ran unopposed, winning all 12,440 votes of the 12,440 who voted. He holds many other titles in the City of San Jose such as the following: Vice Chair of the Public Safety, Finance, and Strategic Support Committee (PSFSS); *Liaison of the Board of Fair Campaign & Political Practices* (formerly Ethics Commission); and many more. He still lives up to his own standards and helps out his community in many ways besides just carrying his main title. By the end of this year, he will continue to be in office and serve the people of San Jose’s District 1 for another term of four years.

### San Jose City Council: District 4

Hailing from District 4 of San Jose, City Councilman Lan Diep has made quite the impression of himself to the general public and City Hall. He was born in Houston, Texas to parents who fled Vietnam and the poverty of war at the time. After moving to San Jose and being raised by his mother, he attended Independence High School.

In his campaign in 2017, Mr. Diep won against incumbent Manh Nguyen: he won by 28 votes, which resulted in a called-for recount, and brought the win to 17 votes ahead. A second recount still resulted in a win for Mr. Diep. How he got his reputation: Mr. Diep brought the shield that was used in the filming of the film “*Captain America*” to his inauguration and wore it proudly, as he says that he wants to make politics and government fun. He takes this pride with him every day as he continues to serve the people of District 4.

### San Jose City Council: District 7

Tam Nguyen serves as the San Jose City Council member from District 7. He immigrated to the United States in 1975, at the age of 18, and settled in Missouri. He later came to San Jose and worked as an engineer while taking MBA courses in his free time. After working as an engineer for some time, Mr. Nguyen realized that the Vietnamese-American community had little representation in society and the public, so he decided to leave the field of engineering to attend Lincoln Law School after receiving his MBA.

He has a strong heart toward the Vietnamese community in San Jose, and he has been very active in advocating for the voice of the people for over 30 years.

### San Jose City Council: District 9

Council Member Donald Rocha of District 9 has addressed many issues to San Jose as a whole, not just his own district. He has served on joint city/county task forces to stress public safety, and he has improved the number of developing projects for healthcare of the people in his community. This year will be his final year as a city council member, for he has served a total of two terms in office. The veteran councilman has spent many years in this position, and he feels that he can put himself to more use elsewhere.

Mr. Rocha is currently campaigning to be part of the County Board of Supervisors, which oversees the government in all cities within the County of Santa Clara. He will be able to facilitate the work of many other cities, not just San Jose, and he will be able to make a difference, still, as a member of our larger community. As of June this year, six politicians ran in primary elections for office, and two are to advance to the general elections this November in a runoff election. It is apparent that the election for this particular seat could, “significantly shift the balance of power on the 11-member council,” according to [sanjoseinside.com](https://www.sanjoseinside.com/2018/06/06/pam-foley-to-face-kalen-gallagher-this-fall-in-san-joses-district-9/).

### San Jose City Council: District 10

Johnny Khamis is the Council Member for District 10. Mr. Khamis attended Oak Grove High School, and he later graduated from San Jose State University with degrees in Business Management and Communication. He started his own company, Western Benefit Solutions, and has been recognized by the Silicon Valley Organization as San Jose's business advocate of the year. On top of that, “Johnny is also the former chair of the Santa Clara County Human Relations Commission and the San Jose Small Business Development Commission,” according to his [website](http://www.sjd10.com/councilmember-johnny-khamis.html).

With his second term in office ending in 2020, he has a few more years to make a difference to our community. Though he would no longer be able to make a difference in his current office in a few years, he has considered running for mayor, as well. Like many of his co-workers at City Hall, Mr. Khamis stressed public safety, family values, and education in ins campaign, and he still adheres to his campaign as he is running through his final years as District 10’s council member.

As we have seen, many of San Jose’s City Council Members have worked hard at their campaigns in the past, and many of them are still running for future terms. All politicians must have their set of standards that they have to run and adhere by them to please the people they serve to be able to run for a second position. We put our faiths, futures and hopes in their hands, and many of them put their life into helping us and what they stand for.

As of earlier this summer, council members from Districts 1, 3, 5, and 7 all ran for re-election while politicians from District 9 are campaigning for the empty seat. This fall on November 6, the San Jose City Council members will be elected for those districts at the same time as the Mayor of San Jose and the midterm elections. At the same time, California’s governor will also be elected as well as our State Representatives for the House. With so many elections going on, there could be a possible shift in power of which political party has control over society, even on a city-community level.
