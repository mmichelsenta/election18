Cristina Osmeña, a congressional candidate for the 14th District in California, is a strong Republican – but she’s not your typical GOP candidate. She’s a proud Filipina immigrant and defines herself as a centrist, neither extremely conservative or liberal.  

“I blur the lines,” Ms. Osmeña said, differentiating herself from the majority of Caucasian male Republicans in Congress. “It’s time for a minority to represent this district.” However, she did show similar behavior to some of the top Republicans when describing her congressional opponent, Jackie Speier, as “Tired Jackie.” 

Ms. Osmeña visited Summit Shasta High School on Aug. 23, at the request of the 2018-19 journalism class, and gave a press conference style interview.

When asked about the recent Michael Cohen case, Ms. Osmeña responded that she doesn’t want to implicate or defend Donald Trump. “It’s disconcerting,” she said. “I only hope whatever solution we come to doesn’t affect the democratic process in this country.”

Ms. Osmeña shares many values and ideas of the Republican party, but she also has some similarities with the Democratic party. While she believes in a smaller government, she does not want to disrupt the democratic process we practice. While she is against open borders, she believes everyone should have to chance to be in this country legally.

Fiscal responsibility is a very important issue to Ms. Osmeña and the Republican party as a whole. She describes herself as a “social liberal, fiscal conservative” and dreams of a government that is “more mindful of their fiscal responsibility.” For example, she argued that “there’s no problem with Social Security as it is now,” adding that “the problem is that it’s going to be more and more lopsided.”

Ms. Osmeña is a very different person than some of the loudest Republican voices today. For starters, as a racial minority, an immigrant and a woman, she already challenges the conservative views of certain members of the current presidential administration. Regarding ideas and stances, she also differs from most of her political peers.

The congressional candidate is not afraid to call out the faults of the Republican party and to acknowledge it has a bad rap. She also regards the Democrats as separate from her, despite what people might assume from her background. Democrats and Republicans are often thought of as synonyms for liberal and conservative, but Ms. Osmeña challenges that.

One student asked the candidate why she should earn the minority vote, to which Ms. Osmeña responded, “When you have a minority in Congress, it’s no longer a large leap.”

Being a minority in a majority could be a step in advancing the typical Republican views, as well as supporting the minority population. “It’s more than just symbolic,” she said, “and I feel like my values would not be so different.”

As an immigrant herself, immigration is an issue close to Ms. Osmeña’s heart. In fact, it’s one of her top issues, as Ms. Osmeña said when asked about her priorities if elected into office. She is a strong supporter of secure borders and believes there should be repercussions for illegal immigration, but that doesn’t mean she isn’t behind immigration as a whole. Ms. Osmeña believes legal immigrants have a rightful place in America.

Ms. Osmeña, as a moderate Republican, might not be what some conservatives think of as a Republican, but she shares many typically GOP values. A number of her beliefs are based around reforming the way the government handles subjects such as money and housing. Cristina Osmeña is a Republican; however, she is ready to turn the tables on the majority.
