Cristina Osmeña, who is running to represent the 14th Congressional District of California against Democratic opponent Jackie Speier, 
wants to focus on making changes for the Bay Area by lowering taxes, being an active participant in the legislature and
trying to implement bills in her first 100 days in office.

On Aug. 23, Ms. Osmeña addressed various issues, such as taxes, housing, transportation and border security at a press conference at
Summit Shasta.

Ms. Osmeña is an immigrant from the Philippines, and she arrived here in the States at the age of six to seek refuge from political 
persecution.

Before she ran to represent the 14th District of California, she was an executive in the solar industry.

According to her [campaign website](https://www.osmenaforcongress.com/about/), she was the Vice President of Corporate 
Development of SunPreme in 2017, which is a privately held-solar module manufacturer based in Sunnyvale, CA (which
is about 45 minutes from San Francisco).

During the press conference, she said that housing in the Bay Area is the most expensive in the United States and that she would address
the cost of living crisis in the Bay Area if she is elected.

Ms. Osmeña said, “In my first 100 days, I will try to implement bills.”

She also talked about problems with money, such as how the government spends money.

Ms. Osmeña said, “I would like to secure more funding for the needs of the district.”

She also addressed the issue that Bay Area taxation is among the highest in the country.

She said that if she gets elected then she would speak out to lower the taxes of families and small businesses.

Ms. Osmeña also wants to help speak out against transportation issues in the Bay Area.

She said that she will secure federal funding to improve roads and other ways of transportation to lessen the amount of people who get 
stuck in traffic.

She also said, “I want to give more people a voice and give people opportunity.”

She also addressed the issues the United States has today regarding the Mexican border and told the press she stands for the border having
a stronger security force.

She said that even though she stands for stronger borders, she still wants there to be more people welcomed into our community with open 
arms.

When a student journalist asked why people should vote for her, she told the press that she would listen to the people and try her best
to grant them what they wish.
