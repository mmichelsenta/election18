                <p>According to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-gavin-newsom-san-francisco-money/">LA Times</a>, Mr. Newsom came from a family connected to politicians: his dad, William Newsom, was a state appeals court judge and Newsom’s family was close friends with former state lawmaker, Willie Brown and John Burton, a former California Democratic Party leader.  His parents got divorced early in his childhood, so Mr. Newsom grew up mainly with his mom, alongside his sister.</p>
                
                <br><br><strong style="clear: left">Background Experiences</strong>
                <p>Mr. Newsom was San Francisco’s mayor from 2003 to 2011.  He got elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014 as California's lieutenant governor.</p>
                <p>Mr. Newsom also was in the business world before he became a politician.  His website, <a href="https://gavinnewsom.com/about">Gavin For Governor</a>, states that he worked in real estate and sales before becoming an entrepreneur and eventually evolving his work into multiple businesses, including the wine, hotel and restaurant industries.  He had some <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article164240567.html">financial assistance</a> from Gordon Getty, son of an oil tycoon who was good friends with Mr. Newsom’s dad, for the start of his businesses.</p>      
                <p>In an <a href="https://abc7.com/politics/gavin-newsom-says-he-would-run-ca-as-positive-alternative-to-trump/3984620/">article by ABC7</a>, Mr. Newsom claims himself as a part of the resistance and says he would be a “positive alternative” to President Trump if he were to run the state.</p>

                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets{{ page.id }}/John_H_Cox.jpg" class="left"/>
                <p>Mr. Cox’s family financially struggled <a href="https://johncoxforgovernor.com/about/">growing up</a>; alongside his brother, Mr. Cox grew up in a single mom household. His mother worked at Calumet High School, a predominately African American high school,  for several years until she remarried to a postal worker.  Working as a CPA after graduating from IIT Chicago Kent College of Law, Mr. Cox eventually started his own business.</p>
                
                <br><strong style="clear: left">Background Experiences</strong>
                <p>Even though he grew up financially struggling, after becoming a CPA Mr. Cox started his own business and transformed it into a company <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-john-cox-california-governor-race-20170919-story.html">worth</a> $200 million.</p>
                <p>While he has had great economic success, he has no political background.  According to the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/John-Cox-California-governor-candidate-says-13058429.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, when asked by the press how he would be able to handle being governor with no experience in the field, he referred to the other 18 states that have governors who came from the business field.  The same article states that he has tried running for office in Illinois five times before but did not succeed.</p>
                <p>As stated by <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article212377084.html">SacBee</a>, President Trump endorsed Mr. Cox in a tweet saying, "California finally deserves a great Governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man — he’ll be the best Governor you've ever had.”  Mr. Cox even used President Trump’s endorsement to his advantage in the last weeks of the primary election in hopes of getting California Republicans to vote for him.</p>

He claims he did it as a “compromise” in order to keep San Francisco a sanctuary city after the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-kate-steinle-murder-immigration-2017-12">Kate Steinle incident</a>.</p> 
                <p>He said to the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Gavin-Newsom-calls-for-fundamental-reforms-13047680.php">SF Chronicle</a> that rather than being abolished, ICE needs to be heavily reformed.

                <p>Mr. Cox says he’s against separating parents and children at the border.  It's also been <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article213412514.html">reported</a> that he agrees with President Trump when he says the separation of parents and their children at the border is Congress’s fault and not the administration's fault.

In fact, according to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-gavin-newsom-gay-marriage-20180515-story.html">Mercury News</a>, in 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court passed Proposition 8, which made same-sex marriages illegal in California.  Not until 2010 did the U.S. Supreme Court overturn it, and it wasn’t until 2015 that gay marriage was legalized nationwide. Now Newsom is advertised as a trailblazer for gay-marriage rights.</p>

Based on the <a href="http://www.keyesarchives.com/transcript.php?id=429">transcript</a> of a political debate in 2007, Mr. Cox associated gay rights with the statement, “Talk about the fact that we can’t open the floodgates to polygamy and bestiality and all kinds of other things.”</p>

In addition to that statement, he also said, “The only way to bring down the cost of homes is more supply.”  So it would also be a fix to the housing crisis California faces, he added.</p>
